### DJS01: Mars Climate Orbiter Challenge

The Mars Climate Orbiter incident in 1999 is a stark reminder of the importance of precision in space missions, highlighting how a simple unit mismatch led to the loss of the spacecraft. This challenge seeks to simulate similar challenges in a spacecraft navigation system, emphasising the need for accuracy in calculations.

##### Initial Parameters

- **Initial Velocity (`vel`)**: The starting speed of the spacecraft, 10,000 km/h.
- **Acceleration (`acc`)**: The spacecraft's acceleration, 3 m/sÂ².
- **Time (`time`)**: The duration of the calculation, 3,600 seconds (equivalent to 1 hour).
- **Initial Distance (`d`)**: The starting distance from the reference point, 0 km.
- **Initial Fuel (`fuel`)**: The starting amount of fuel, 5,000 kg.
- **Fuel Burn Rate (`fbr`)**: The rate at which fuel is consumed, 0.5 kg/s.

##### Expected Corrected Results

- **New Velocity**: Approximately 48880 km/h after correction.
- **New Distance**: Approximately 10000 km after correction.
- **Remaining Fuel**: Approximately 3,200 kg after correction.

### Challenges faced in the project
The challenges which i faced was doing the conversion for the velocity to be in meters per seconds, and be able to use the velocityMs it trought out the whole code.
Another challenge was coverting back to km/s from m/s for the new velocity to be able to meet the corrected new velocity in km/s

## ðŸ“š what I Learned
1. **Identify and Understand Errors**: Analyse the provided functions to determine how unit mismatches and parameter misalignments cause incorrect results.
2. **Refactor and Correct**: Modify the functions to handle parameters more effectively, incorporating object destructuring for clarity and implementing necessary unit conversions.
3. Implementing accurate unit conversions within the functions
